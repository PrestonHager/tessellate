        This is the fourth section. You can add more content here as needed.

The fourth section can also contain multiple paragraphs. This is much like the
third section except you may customize the number of columns using the `columns`
key in the front matter. For example:

```yaml
---
columns: 2
---
```

---

This will create two columns of content. The default is three columns. Likewise,
the horizontal rule (`---`) can be used to separate paragraphs. Otherwise, the
plugin will try to "smartly" break the content into the specified number of
columns.
