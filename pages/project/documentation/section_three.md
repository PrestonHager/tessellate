Third section is here. It is split up into three "paragraphs" which should only
break at the end of each sentence or paragraph. The ruby plugin driving this
content tries to be smart, however, you may run into issues.

If you find that you can't get it to break correctly, you may use the same
method as section one where each paragraph is separated by a markdown divider of
dashes (`---`).

This also means that if you want to use only one or two
horizontal lines in your content you'll have to use an HTML block to do so. This
can be done using an `<hr />` tag.

You can also include lists, images, or other content as you see fit. For
example:

 + Item 1
 + Item 2
 + Item 3
